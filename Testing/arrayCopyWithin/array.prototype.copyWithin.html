    /* 
    On the left is the procedure I took for writing array methods all the way up to `Array.prototype.every`. It has worked well for me. 

    I have to admit this is not the first attempt of rewriting `copyWithin`, and I do admit this method seems a lot harder than the previous methods encountered. But I still have faith in the procedure. I will try to stick with the steps here. 

    After Friday's daily meeting, one thing sticks to my mind in writing tests is this: "don't worry how trivial your tests may seem, just write tests to test on the smallest features or uses cases possible". I think this is the key to discover all the use cases or tests, which is the most difficult part of the job. 

    Also `copyWithin` is different from the other methods I have encountered so far, because its specs almost has no description. In other words, the docs is not guided by the description in the specs (Of course the pseudo code is available).  

    So, I will try to dig as many tests as possible from docs alone for now.

    By now, I admit my approach is to mindlessly follow the docs line by line and try to dig as many tests as possible, which may seem somewhat different from the approach taken by the Friday's meeting. I hope my approach can eventually guide me successfully rewrite copyWithin step by step.
