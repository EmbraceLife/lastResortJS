    /* 
    first of all, let's think about the third argument, array, inside callback function.
    this array refers to or is the same to the array we pass into the forEach function.
    To test on this third argument, what shall I do? Basically, I need to run a forEach function to get the arrayOptional (the third arg) of callback out and check whether it is equal to array I pass into forEach.
    OK, let's write the test
    */

    tests({
      // we write the actual test inside the property/method
      'the third arrayOptional arg of callback should be equal to the array I pass to forEach': function(){

        // here we write the test 
        var arrayOutside;
        var array = [7];/* also be aware that if we are comparing [7] and [7], they won't be equal as they are comparing addresses not reference. That's why I am using variables to compare, this way arrayOutside and array both refer to the same reference [7] */

        forEach(/* the array we pass in */ array, 
        
        /* the callback function */ function(currentValue, indexOptional, arrayOptional){
          // here we can access arrayOptional and it should be the same to array, so we need to move arrayOptional outside this forEach function. we can use a global variable (i.e., variable outside forEach) to do it
          arrayOutside = arrayOptional;
        }
        );
        // now this outside array shall be equal to array
        eq(arrayOutside, array); /* now, we need to specify the array */

        // let's check with debugger
      }
    })
    // we need to define forEach function, and it is clear to define outside tests().
    function forEach(/* array is a must */ array, /* so does callback */ callback){
      /* how to pass items of array to callback, we use for-loop */
      for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        callback(/* get the currentValue */ array[i], /* also need indexOptional */ i, /* now we need the arrayOptional, which is the same array passed into forEach */ array);
      }
