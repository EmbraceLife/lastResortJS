      the problem: 

      no matter with or without librarySystem, the `sandwichLibrary` is overwritten from the string to the object defined below. 

      How can we keep both the old sandwichLibrary and the new one?
      
      `noConflict` defined as a method in the library (IIFE) can assign the string under window.sandwichLibrary and assign sandwichLibrary the object into another variable in the global. 

      1. save the old/existing sandwichLibrary (the string) into another variable 'old_lib': `var old_lib = window.sandwichLibrary;`
      2. when noConflict is called: 
        2.1 assign 'old_lib' to window.sandwichLibrary
        2.2 return sandwichLibrary the object
        noConflict: function(){
          window.sandwichLibrary = old_lib;
          return sandwichLibrary;
        }
      */

            libraryStorage[libraryName] = callback(); 
          } else { 
            return libraryStorage[libraryName]; 
          }
        }

        window.librarySystem = librarySystem; 
      })();  

      (function enclosingSandwichLibrary(){
        var breads = {
          wheat: "healthy",
          white: "unhealthy",
        }

        var fillings = {
          turkey: "boring",
          cheeze: "vege",
        }

        var sandwichLibrary = {
          breads: breads,
          fillings: fillings,
        }

        if (typeof librarySystem !== undefined) {/* if librarySystem function is available, we save the lib into LibraryStorage */
          librarySystem("sandwichLibrary", function(){
            return sandwichLibrary
          });
        } else {
          window.sandwichLibrary = sandwichLibrary; /* if librarySystem is not available, we directly deliver the lib into the global */
        }

        var old_lib = window.sandwichLibrary;/* save the existing (old) lib into a new variable */

        sandwichLibrary.noConflict = function() { /* a new method */
          window.sandwichLibrary = old_lib;/* save old_lib into the global lib */
          return sandwichLibrary; /* return lib the object for a new lib */

      var sandwichLibrary = librarySystem("sandwichLibrary");
      var new_lib = sandwichLibrary.noConflict();
      var another = new_lib.noConflict();/* run noConflict again won't do any damage */
        
      /* go to accounting.js, the module definition, see how noConflict is defined. 
      
      In fact they work exactly the same, and it is not necessary for accounting to remove noConflict after it ran the first time. 

      underscore.js has the most simple version of noConflict like what we write here.
